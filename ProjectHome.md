Traymemo is a shortcut orientated note making tool which runs in the system tray. Philosophy behind traymemo is to have an easy and fast to access simple application for making notes, saving copied text and f.ex keeping a memo for different issues. Notes are saved to text files which are opened on tabs on the simple graphical interface.
